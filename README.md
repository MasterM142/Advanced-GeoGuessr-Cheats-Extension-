# Advanced GeoGuessr Cheats Extension

This is a userscript designed to enhance the GeoGuessr experience by providing real-time location assistance.  It displays an embedded map with the correct location and adds an optional overlay marker to the in-game map.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Real-time Coordinate Extraction:** Intercepts Google Street View API calls to determine the precise coordinates of the current location.
*   **Embedded Map:** Displays a draggable and resizable map showing the exact location. Uses OpenStreetMap for the map display.
*   **Overlay Marker:** Places a visual marker on the GeoGuessr map, indicating the extracted coordinates.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    *   `1`: Toggle the embedded map visibility.
    *   `2`: Create the overlay marker.
    *   `3`: Remove the overlay marker.
    *   `4`: Open the location in Google Maps in a new tab.
    *   `5`: Copy the coordinates to the clipboard.
*   **Status Updates:** Provides informative messages via an on-screen status display, indicating the script's activity and potential issues.
*   **Cheat Detection Mitigation:** Attempts to remove potential cheat detection scripts from the page.
*   **Automatic Map Updates:** Periodically updates the overlay marker's position to keep it aligned with the in-game map, even when the user zooms or pans.
*   **Draggable Embedded Map:**  Allows the user to reposition the embedded map anywhere on the screen.

## Technology Stack

*   **JavaScript:** Core logic of the userscript.
*   **Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey:**  Userscript manager required to run the script.
*   **OpenStreetMap:** Used for displaying the embedded map.
*   **Google Maps API (Interception):** The script intercepts calls to Google's internal Maps API to extract location data.

## Prerequisites

*   A browser with a userscript manager installed (e.g., Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox).
*   An active internet connection.
*   A GeoGuessr account (for playing the game).

## Installation Instructions

1.  Install a userscript manager for your browser:
    *   **Chrome:** [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
    *   **Firefox:** [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2.  Click on the following link to install the script directly from Greasy Fork: [Geoguessr Location Resolver (Overlay Only)](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/450253/Geoguessr%20Location%20Resolver%20%28Works%20in%20all%20modes%29.user.js)
3.  The userscript manager will prompt you to confirm the installation.  Click "Install".
4.  Open or refresh the GeoGuessr website ([https://www.geoguessr.com/\*](https://www.geoguessr.com/*)).

## Usage Guide

1.  Start a game on GeoGuessr.
2.  The script will automatically attempt to extract coordinates from the Google Street View API calls.
3.  An embedded map will appear in the top-left corner of the screen.  If it doesn't appear automatically, wait a few seconds.
4.  Use the keyboard shortcuts (1-5) to toggle the embedded map, create/remove the overlay marker, open the location in Google Maps, or copy the coordinates.
5.  The embedded map is draggable by its header; click and drag to reposition. You can also resize it using the "â†”" button in the header.
6.  The status display at the top of the embedded map provides information on the script's activity.

## API Documentation
